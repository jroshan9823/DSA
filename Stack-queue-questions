Sure, here are some common stack and queue interview questions:
Stack Questions:

Implement a stack data structure:

Write code to implement a stack using an array or a linked list.
Implement the push, pop, peek, and isEmpty operations.


Reverse a string using a stack:

Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the reversed string using a stack data structure.


Check for balanced parentheses:

Given a string containing parentheses, braces, and brackets, write a function to check if the parentheses are balanced.


Evaluate postfix/reverse Polish notation:

Write a program to evaluate a postfix/reverse Polish notation expression using a stack.


Sort a stack:

Write a program to sort the elements of a stack in ascending or descending order.



Queue Questions:

Implement a queue data structure:

Write code to implement a queue using an array or a linked list.
Implement the enqueue, dequeue, front, rear, and isEmpty operations.


Reverse the first k elements of a queue:

Given a queue and an integer k, write a function to reverse the order of the first k elements in the queue.


Generate binary numbers from 1 to n using a queue:

Write a program to print all binary numbers from 1 to n using a queue data structure.


Implement a circular tour problem:

Given a circular array of gas stations and the amount of gas and cost to travel to the next station, find the starting station from which you can complete the circular tour.


Implement a priority queue:

Write code to implement a priority queue data structure.
Implement the enqueue, dequeue, and peek operations based on priority.



These questions cover various aspects of stack and queue data structures, including implementation, manipulation, and problem-solving scenarios. Make sure to understand the underlying concepts, time and space complexities, and be prepared to write clean and efficient code during the interview. Copy


Conceptual Questions:

Explain the difference between a Stack and a Queue.

A Stack follows LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle, where the element added last is removed first. Think of a stack of plates, you remove the top plate you added last.
A Queue follows FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle, where the element added first is removed first. Imagine a line at a store, the person who joined the line first gets served first.
Describe real-world applications of Stacks and Queues.

Stacks: Backtracking algorithms, browser history, undo/redo functionality in applications.
Queues: Task scheduling, managing printer jobs, handling requests in a server.
What are the time complexities of basic operations (push, pop, enqueue, dequeue) for Stacks and Queues?

For both stacks and queues, these operations are typically constant time (O(1)) in well-implemented scenarios.
Coding and Implementation Questions:

Implement a Stack or Queue using an Array.

This is a basic question to test your understanding of the underlying data structure.
Implement a Queue using two Stacks.

This requires some creative thinking and manipulation of stacks to achieve FIFO behavior.
Reverse a String using a Stack.

Stacks are perfect for reversing operations due to their LIFO nature.
Check for balanced parentheses in an expression using a Stack.

Stacks help keep track of opening parentheses and ensure they are closed in the correct order.
Advanced Questions:

Sort a Stack using recursion or a temporary stack.
Implement multiple stacks in a single array.
Additional Tips:

Be prepared to discuss the trade-offs between using stacks and queues for specific problems.
Be able to analyze the time and space complexity of your solutions.
If you get stuck, explain your thought process and ask clarifying questions from the interviewer.
